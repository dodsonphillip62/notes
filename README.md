# 2023-11-21
- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan your time wisely, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors.

First, prioritize your tasks. When you're working on a project, there will always be multiple things that need to get done. By identifying which tasks are most important and which can wait, you can make sure that you focus on the right things. Use a task management tool, such as Trello or Asana, to keep track of your work and make adjustments as needed.

 Second, wisely plan and allocate your timetime. Set aside specific blocks of time for each task, taking into account the complexity and importance of the task. For example, if you needto perform a complex analysis, allocate more time than ifyou were just fixing a small bug. Also, don't forget to take breaks every now and then to avoid burnout and maintain your focus. Using a timer or scheduling tool like Pomodoro Technique can help with this.- ---
 Finally, stayorganized. Keep your code, project files,and documentation well-organized and up-to-date.This will make it easier for you and other team members to find and understand the code. Follow a consistent coding style and convention, use version control systems like Git, keep your editor or IDE well configured, follow the principles of DRY (Don'ts Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).

- Today's programming wisdom is to always prioritize code readability and maintainability. This means writing concise, well-structured, and easy-to-understand code that can be easily modified and expanded upon as needed. To achieve this, follow these best practices:

1. Use clear variable, function, method, class, module, etc. names that accurately represent their purpose and functionality.
2. Follow coding conventions and standards for the language and framework you're using. These guidelines exist to ensure consistency and reduce the risk of mistakes. They also make it easier for other developers to understand and work with your code. 
3. Break your Code up into logical, modular pieces, each with a well defined purpose.This makes it easy to reason about your program and to add new features or make changes. It also makes your work more reusable and easier to maintain.  
4. Comment your codeso that others can understand it. Write comments that explain what the code does, why it' s there, how it works, any known issues, or anything else that might be helpful for someone else to know. Avoid excessive commenting, but do provide sufficient context to make the intent of the Code clear.   
5. Refactor and optimize your Codeso it is as efficient and effective as possible. Look for opportunities to simplify your logic, eliminate duplication, reduce boilerplate, avoid global variables, use local functions, minimize mutable state, optimize loops, cache computations, reuse code,etc. Doing so will not only make your current code better but also future code you write.    
6. Learn from others and share your knowledge. Read other people' code and learn from it, share what you know with others, ask questions, participate in discussions, attend workshops, read books, blogs, articles, watch videos, listen to podcasts, join communities, network with fellow developers,and more. Continuous learning and growth is crucial for becoming a better programmer.

- "Every line of code you write is a liability. It will have to be maintained, debugged, tested, and understood by someone else in the future. Therefore, always strive to write clean, simple, and readable code that minimizes the amount of code you need to write." 

This quote emphasizes the importance of writing high-quality code that is easy to understand and maintain. Every line of code we write has the potential to create problems down the road, so it's important to be mindful of this as we write our code. By striving to write clean, simple, and readable code, we can minimize the amount of code we need to write, which in turn reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs or making mistakes. Ultimately, this leads to more efficient and effective software development.
